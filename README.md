# Game of Life
Yet another implemantation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. With C++ and the great SFML library

## Compiling
This program was written in an environment using SFML 2.4.2 and GCC 5.4. The code use C++14 features.
Here is the complete command line used to compile this program, from the folder root folder :

```bash
g++ ./**/*.cpp -std=c++14 -I/usr/local/include/ -I. -I./classes -o./build/automaton -L/usr/local/lib -lsfml-graphics-d -lsfml-window-d -lsfml-system-d
```

## Using
#### Keys : 
Mouse Wheel or PageUp/PageDown to Zoom in and out
+ and âˆ’ key to speed up / slow the simulation
Enter to switch from drawing to simulation mode
Left click on cells to toggle their state in drawing mode
Right click in drawing mode to select and delete multiple cells at once
Escape for quit menu.


## A word
This program needs a lot of polishing, code refactoring, debugging. The goal was to achieve a working "Game of Life" simulation, so it is published as is.
There is an error in implementation of the "infinite grid" which has impact on the simulation. That bug will be corrected soon.
Many thanks to SFML's contributors, it really is a great and fun library to use.
