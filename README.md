# Game of Life
Yet another implemantation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.
With C++17 and the great SFML library.

## Compilation
This program will compile on any machine running Linux, MacOS or Windows with the SFML library version 2.4.2 or higher installed, and a C++17 compiler.
You need to link against the C++ standard filesystem library.

For instance, you can obtain a release build with GCC 8.1 and the following command line, from the project root folder :

```bash
g++ ./**/*.cpp -std=c++17 -O3 -I. -I./classes -o./build/automaton -lstdc++fs -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

Add `-I/path/to/SFML/includes` and `-L/path/to/SFML/libraries` if needed.

## Usage
The program is divided in two modes : the editing and the simulation mode. It starts in editing mode, in which you can draw live cells or erase them with the mouse. Then, on a press on the return key, the simulation starts, until you press this key again. You cannot draw in simulation mode.

#### Keys :
+ Left click on cells to toggle their state in drawing mode.
+ Right click in drawing mode to select and delete multiple cells.
+ Mouse Wheel or PageUp/PageDown to Zoom in and out.
+ '+' and 'âˆ’' key to speed up / slow down the simulation.
+ Return to switch from drawing to simulation mode.
+ Escape for the quit menu.
+ Z to set back the default zoom level.
+ C to go back to the center of the grid.
+ B to go back in time (drawing mode).
+ F to manually go forward (drawing mode).


## A word
This program needs refactoring and the addition of numerous features like a proper UI, app states, messaging system between classes, and some other cool stuff.
The primary goal was to obtain a working "Game of Life" simulation. This is achieved, so it is published as is for now.

Many thanks to SFML's contributors, it is really a great and fun library to use.
